//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
let names = ["Maryam", "Saima", "Sahar", "Esha", "Noor", "Zeenat", "Shaheen"];
// use of loop to send personalized message to friends
for (let name of names) {
    console.log(`Asalam-O-Alikum! ${name} , How are you?`);
}
